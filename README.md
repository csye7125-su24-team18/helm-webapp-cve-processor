# Assignment_03
# Overview
### In this repository, we use Docker images created within the repository to construct a Helm chart with versioning capabilities. This Helm chart is designed to run two containers: an init container for database migration and another container for the web application, which inserts data into the database.

## Project Structure
## Docker Images:
### Database Migration: Utilizes Flyway for managing database versioning and migrations.
### Web Application: A Golang application that processes and inserts data into the PostgreSQL database.

# Helm Chart:
### Manages the deployment of the two containers.
### Ensures versioning and proper orchestration of the init container and web application.
